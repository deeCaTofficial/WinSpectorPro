    verification_comment: The description 'Кэш настроек драйверов NVIDIA' (NVIDIA
      driver settings cache) is conceptually accurate. NVIDIA drivers do utilize various
      caches for settings, shaders, and other data to improve performance. While there
      isn't a single, universally exposed file named exactly 'nvidia_driver_settings_cache',
      the concept of such a cache is valid. If the implied recommendation is to clear
      or delete this cache, it is generally safe for a general user. The primary consequence
      would be a temporary performance reduction (e.g., stuttering in games) as the
      cache rebuilds, or a potential reset of some minor driver-specific settings,
      but it will not cause system instability or permanent damage.
