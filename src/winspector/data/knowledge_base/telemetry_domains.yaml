    verification_comment: The description accurately states the purpose of this domain.
      It is indeed used by Yandex Browser to send crash reports, which is a common
      practice for software improvement. There is no explicit recommendation given,
      but understanding its function allows a user to make an informed and safe decision
      regarding its network access (e.g., via firewall rules).

    verification_comment: The description is accurate. 'appcenter.ms' is a Microsoft
      service (App Center) that provides crash reporting capabilities, among other
      things. Visual Studio Code, being a Microsoft product, can indeed utilize this
      service for sending crash reports. Disabling such a feature (if that's the implied
      recommendation) is generally safe, as it only affects telemetry/data collection,
      not core functionality.

    verification_comment: The description accurately identifies 'telemetry.nvidia.com'
      as an NVIDIA telemetry endpoint and correctly associates it with the 'NvContainerTelemetryApi.dll'
      component, which is part of NVIDIA's telemetry collection system. Blocking this
      domain typically only affects data collection, not core driver functionality.

    verification_comment: The description is accurate. 'telemetry.amd.com' is indeed
      used for collecting telemetry data as part of AMD's User Experience Program.
      Blocking this domain is generally safe and primarily affects data collection,
      not core system or driver functionality.

    verification_confidence: 0.95
    verification_comment: The description accurately identifies 'vortex.data.microsoft.com'
      as a key endpoint for Microsoft's telemetry and diagnostic data collection,
      including aspects related to Edge, WebView2, and internal classification/usage
      metrics (UKM, AI Tracker Classification, UMA). The statement itself does not
      recommend any action, so there is no safety concern.

    verification_comment: The description accurately identifies this domain as a telemetry
      endpoint for Windows settings and Edge WebView2 usage data. There is no explicit
      recommendation for action in the statement, only a description.
- domain: variations.browser.yandex.net
  description_ru: Сбор данных для A/B тестирования и конфигурации функций Yandex Browser,

  category: Telemetry

  provenance:
    added_by: ai_suggestion_v3.8
    verified_by: ai_peer_review
    verification_confidence: 0.98
    verification_comment: The description accurately reflects the purpose of 'variations.browser.yandex.net'.
      This domain is indeed used by Yandex Browser (and similar mechanisms by other
      Chromium-based browsers) for A/B testing, feature flagging, and dynamic configuration
      updates. The `--variations-seed-version` flag is also correctly associated with
      this process. While it involves data collection for testing, it's a standard
      mechanism for browser development and feature rollout, and the statement itself
      does not provide an unsafe recommendation.

  description_ru: Телеметрия Visual Studio Code, отправляемая в Azure Operational

  category: Telemetry
  breakage_risk: low
  provenance:
    added_by: ai_suggestion_v3.8
    verified_by: ai_peer_review
    verification_confidence: 0.9
    verification_comment: The domain 'prod.telemetry.opinsights.azure.com' is a legitimate
      Microsoft Azure endpoint associated with Azure Monitor (formerly Operational
      Insights), which is used for collecting telemetry and log data from various
      Microsoft services. Visual Studio Code does send telemetry, and it is plausible
      that this data, or a portion of it, is routed through or processed by services
      utilizing this domain. Blocking it would prevent this specific telemetry from
      being sent, which is safe and does not impact VS Code's core functionality.
